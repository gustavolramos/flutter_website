# my_first_website

My first website to practice flutter with a real example.

In order to make this project work, you need to install both the Flutter and Dart plugins to your
IDE, I'm currently using IntelliJ

You also need to download the Flutter SDK, which you can do from
here: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

Some Bio sites I used as an inspiration:
