# my_first_website

In this project I try to exercise some basic but important Dart and Flutter concepts such as:

- Altering the project`s font family, weight, etc
- Utilizing the "Responsive Builder" package to achieve responsivity
- Utilizing assets
- Navigating through different pages
- Re-utilizing Widgets through the app
- Organizing project files, class names, variables, etc in a meaningful way

## Requirements to run the project

Android Studio or other IDE: http://bit.ly/3IWeWfC
Flutter SDK: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
Flutter and Dart Plugins for the IDE

Responsive Builder package (https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences)

I created this alongisde a Filledstacks (https://www.youtube.com/@FilledStacks) video and improved
things based on it.
